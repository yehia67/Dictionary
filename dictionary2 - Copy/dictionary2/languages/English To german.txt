I assume that these facts are known
I became familiar with him.
I beg to differ.
I beg your pardon
I beg your pardon!
I beg your pardon?
I call it a day.
I called at your house.
I can do it by myself
I can do it on my head.
I can ill afford it.
I can make nothing of it.

I carried my point.
I chanced to hear it
I chanced to hear it.
I chanced to meet her.
I couldn't believe my ears (eyes)

I count on you.
I dare say
I dare say it's only a matter of habit.
I dare say you're right.
I dare say.
I dare you!
I daren't go home
I decided to keep him at arm's length.
I defy anyone to do it
I defy you to do it
I did it at his suggestion
I didn't catch the sentence.
I didn't catch the word
I didn't get a wink of sleep.
I didn't quite catch what you said.
I don't agree
I don't believe a word of it
I don't care a fig for it.
I don't care a pap for it.
I don't care any more
I don't feel happy about it

my blood was up
My goose is cooked.
My hair stood on end.
my hands are tied
My head swims.
my heart beats fast
my late father
My pain has gone.

My sight is very poor.
My turn will come.
